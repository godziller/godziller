### 📂 **Projects**

#### 🧮 [Matrix Multiplier Performance Benchmark](https://github.com/godziller/matrix_multiplier)
Python | Docker | Virtualization
A Python-based matrix multiplier designed for performance benchmarking. The project measures the impact of different environments on computational performance. It implements matrix multiplication using NumPy and runs performance tests in multiple configurations:

Native: Running the script directly on the host system.
VirtualBox: Testing in a VirtualBox VM with varying system configurations.
Docker (Native): Running the matrix multiplier in a Docker container on the host system.
Docker in a VM: Docker image pushed to Docker Hub and tested in a container inside a VirtualBox VM.
This project demonstrates how virtualization and containerization affect compute-heavy tasks like matrix multiplication.
Technologies: Python, Docker, VirtualBox

#### 🃏 [Pontoon Card Game](https://github.com/godziller/pontoon)  
**Python** | **Docker**  
A card game built using OOP in Python. Deployed as a Docker container and available on DockerHub.  
*Technologies: Python, Docker, DockerHub*

#### 🔧 [MIPS Assembly Floating Point Conversion](https://github.com/godziller/cs2705_comp_arch/tree/master/ca_assignment)  
**MIPS Assembly**  
A low-level MIPS assembly project that converts a floating-point string input into its hexadecimal representation using IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic. This required in-depth understanding of floating-point operations, bitwise manipulation, and memory handling in MIPS.  
*Technologies: MIPS Assembly, IEEE 754, mips-linux-gnu-as, xxd, objdump*

#### ✅ [Task Tracking To-Do App](https://github.com/godziller/cs1116_web_dev/tree/master/public_html/cgi-bin/ca1)  
**Flask** | **JavaScript**  
Full-stack task tracking application with Flask backend and JavaScript frontend. Pytest used for robust unit testing, deployed using Docker.  
*Technologies: Flask, JavaScript, Pytest, Docker*

#### 🎮 [JavaScript Game](https://github.com/godziller/cs1116_web_dev)  
**JavaScript**  
A browser-based game with dynamic interactions, scoring, and optimized gameplay using JavaScript.  
*Technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3*
